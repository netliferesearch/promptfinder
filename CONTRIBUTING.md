# DesignPrompts Changelog

## [1.1.2] - 2025-08-12

### UI/UX

- Added a sticky controls bar in the prompt details view with a right-aligned Copy Prompt button for better accessibility while scrolling
- Restyled Back to list as a subdued gray pill so it doesn’t compete with the primary copy action
- Matched View more/View less styling with bordered pill treatment; added hover/focus affordances
- Reverted inline code copy control back to an icon; added padding/margin around the sticky bar for visual breathing room

### Functionality

- Usage count now increments for logged-out (anonymous) users when copying a prompt; details view updates accordingly

### Reliability & Tests

- `findPromptById` now gracefully falls back to Firestore in test environments to avoid callable interference
- Updated tests to expect `userId` in callable payloads and to reflect anonymous usage counting
- Reduced noisy test logs by suppressing function retrieval errors in tests; ensured all suites pass

### Build & Tooling

- Fixed build lint error by safely detecting test environment without referencing undefined globals
- Verified: full test suite green and development build succeeds

## [1.1.1] - 2025-08-11

### Fix

- Bump manifest/package version to 1.1.1 for Chrome Web Store (greater than 1.1)

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-11

### UI/UX

- Moved sticky search to the top of the main view (remains sticky while scrolling)
- Added spacing below tab buttons to prevent clipping
- Header logo is now a home button that contextually navigates:
  - From signup form → back to signup methods
  - From login email form → back to sign-in methods
  - Otherwise → back to main list view

### Auth flow

- New signup method chooser (mirrors sign-in): “Sign up with Google” and “Sign up with email”
- “Sign up with email” reveals a compact form that fits the popup frame
- Back flows consistently restore the relevant chooser and keep the signup link visible

### Polish

- Compact styling for signup form to avoid scroll on small frames
- Minor accessibility improvements to header logo button
